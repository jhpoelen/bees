This more than 150-year-old commitment remains a strong and proud tradition for the MCZ.\n\nThe present-day MCZ contains over 21-million specimens in ten research collections which comprise one of the world's richest and most varied resources for studying the diversity of life. The museum serves as the primary repository for zoological specimens collected by past and present Harvard faculty-curators, staff and associates conducting research around the world.\n\nAs a premier university museum and research institution, the specimens and their related data are available to researchers of the scientific and museum community.","logo":"http://digir.mcz.harvard.edu/ipt/logo.do?r=mczbase","url":"http://mczbase.mcz.harvard.edu/","emllink":"http://digir.mcz.harvard.edu/ipt/eml.do?r=mczbase","archivelink":"http://digir.mcz.harvard.edu/ipt/archive.do?r=mczbase","contacts":[{"first_name":"MCZ","last_name":"Harvard University"},{"first_name":"Paul J.","last_name":"Morris","role":"Biodiversity Informatics Manager","email":"bdim@oeb.harvard.edu"},{"first_name":"Paul J.","last_name":"Morris","role":"Biodiversity Informatics Manager","email":"mole@oeb.harvard.edu"},{"first_name":"Linda S.","last_name":"Ford","role":"Director of Collections Operations","email":"lford@oeb.harvard.edu"},{"first_name":"Brendan","last_name":"Haley","role":"Senior Database Manager","email":"bhaley@oeb.harvard.edu"},{"last_name":"President and Fellows of Harvard College","role":"President and Fellows"},{"first_name":"Brendan","last_name":"Haley","role":"Senior Database Manager","email":"bhaley@oeb.harvard.edu"}],"data_rights":"CC4 BY-NC","publisher":"d347ee15-f16e-4650-930c-4e54d9ce549e","totalCount":2083571}}
